### Description
For my Internet of Things module, I decided to prototype a proof of concept of an IoT solution that flashes light at an area in a library when users would to get too loud.
This would deter library users from disturbing the silence, allowing librarians to focus on shelving books and other administratives.

This IoT solution comprises of two parts,
1. Web Application Console
2. Raspberry Pi Program (![Repository](https://github.com/chuabingquan/iot-ca1-rpi))

### Implementation
The web application console for this IoT solution utilizes NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, Socket.IO and MQTT to bridge between the web client and the Raspberry Pi device to allow for control and monitoring of the entire solution.
